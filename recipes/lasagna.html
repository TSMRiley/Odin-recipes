                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>A great lasagna only needs two things: a 
                thick, rich, super-meaty sauce (and lots of it!) 
                and a ricotta filling where only the finest 
                cheeses are welcomed. For the sauce, He loves a 
                50-50 combo of Italian sausage and lean ground 
                beef.</p>

                <h3>Directions:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make the sauce: Cook and stir ground beef and sausage 
                            in a large saucepan over medium heat until browned 
                            and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, 
                            salt, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and pepper 
                            flakes. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook 
                            until mushrooms have given off their juices and the 
                            bottom of the pan is almost dry, 4 to 6 minutes. 
                        </li>
                            <h4></h4>
                        <li>Pour marinara sauce into meat mixture. (If using jarred
                                sauce, add a little water to each jar and shake to 
                                get all sauce out of the jar; add to meat mixture.
                                ) Reduce the heat to low and simmer until meat is 
                                extremely tender, about 2 hours; add more water if 
                                sauce becomes too thick. Skim fat, then season sauce
                                with salt and black pepper. Turn off the heat. 
                        </li>
                            <h4></h4>
                        <li>When the sauce is almost finished, make the pasta: Bring
                                a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
                            in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until
                            cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
                            Drain and rinse lasagna noodles; set aside in a 
                            bowl of cold water.
                        </li>
                            <h4></h4>
                        <li>
                            While the pasta is cooking, make the filling: Whisk
                            eggs in a large bowl, then stir in ricotta, mozzarella, 
                            Parmigiano-Reggiano, parsley, salt, black pepper, 
                            and cayenne. 
                        </li>
                            <h4></h4>
                        <li>
                            When the sauce, pasta, and filling are ready, preheat
                            the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                        </li>
                            <h4></h4>
                        <li>
                            Divide sauce into fourths, noodles into thirds, and 
                            filling in half for layering. Layer ingredients in a
                            10x15-inch baking pan, spreading out to fill the 
                            pan, as follows: one part sauce, one part noodles, 
                            one part filling. Repeat once more. Add one part 
                            sauce, then tap the dish lightly on a sturdy work 
                            surface to settle the layers. Continue with one 
                            part noodles and one part sauce. Sprinkle remaining 
                            fresh mozzarella and Parmigiano-Reggiano over top.
                        </li>
                            <h4></h4>
                        <li>
                            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure 
                            it doesn't touch the cheese. Place onto a baking 
                            sheet to catch any spills.
                        </li>
                            <h4></h4>
                        <li>
                            Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove 
                            the foil and continue to bake until golden brown 
                            and bubbly, 30 to 35 more minutes. Let sit for 20 
                            minutes before serving.
                        </li>
